# Galactic_Chaos

The objective of this repository is to integrate the trajectories of stars in galaxies, as we can study by variating two parameters b and c the chaos generated in the solutions. 

The programming language used is **Python3.10**. 
We include a virtual environment and a *requirements.txt* to install all the external packages. We used:
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Random

**IMPORTANT**: In this work, we will implicitly use the astronomical units, as the calculations we perform make sense in this system of units:

| Magnitud  | Unit |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Space (x)  | kpc  |
| time (t)  | Gyr  |
| Energy (E)  | $km^2/s^2$  |
| Velocity (v)  | $km/s$  |
| Aceleration (a)  |  $km^2/s^2$ |
| Angular momentum (Lz)  | $km^2/s$  |

*Note that we don't use the mass, as everyting is normalised to it*

## CHAOS.py file
This is the main file of the repository. In it we find the definition of the class **Chaos** in which we find all the necesary tools for the study.

**Input**
* *Initial velocities*: vx0, vy0, vz0 in all three cartesian axes.
* *Time-step of integration*: dt
* *Asymetry parameters*: b and c. We recommend for physical cases to maintain the criteria c < b and both between 0 and 1. The parameter b introduces an asymetry in the y coordinate and the c in the z component. Both act on the potential $\Phi$.
* *Reference length*: rc. It will act on the $\Phi$ aswell. For bound-states we want rc at least bigger than the initial module $|\textbf{r}| = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$

**Methods**
* *Chaos.v(vx = float, vy = float, vz = float)*: Returns the module of the velocity.
* *Chaos.phi(x = float, y = float, z = float)*: Returns the value of the logaritmic potential.
$$\Phi = \frac{v_0^2}{2}\log|\frac{x^2+y^2+z^2}{r_c^2}|$$
* *Chaos.a(x = float, y = float, z = float)*: Returns the value of acceleration derived from the logaritmic potentioal.
$$\textbf{a} = -\nabla\Phi$$
* *Chaos.verlet(x0 = float, y0 = float, z0 = float, k = int)*: Input of the initial position and returns the integrated trajectories in the phase space. It also returns energy and time, and the Poincare section of $x$ and $\dot{x}$. The integration method is based on Verlet integration:

$$\textbf{x}_{i+1} = \textbf{x}_i + \textbf{v}_i*dt + \frac{1}{2}\textbf{a}(\textbf{x}_i)*dt^2$$

$$\textbf{v}_{i+1} = \textbf{v}_i + \textbf{a}(x_i)*dt$$

This method returns:
  * *pos*(list): This is a list that saves all data points of the three coordinates of space. [*Ex:* pos[0] = list of x points]
  * *vel*(list): A list of the velocity in each coordinate. [*Ex*: vel[2] = list of $v_z$ points]
  * *energy* (list): List of energy for each point in \{ $\textbf{x},\textbf{v}$ \}. It also returns time and $L_z$ for the values of the first index 1 and 2 respectively.
  * *poin* (list): It is a list of the dots for the Poincare's section in y = 0, z > 0. [*Ex*: poin[0]: positions in the Poincare's section. poin[1]: velocities in the Poincare's section]


Also, an important thing that this program does, is generating directories with the name of the parameters used, where the trajectories of each star emulated are saved on a datak.txt file (with k the number of the star). This is important because we will use not only the file plots.ipynb to plot everything we need but also gnuplot as it's better to see what's happening in real time.

## plots.ipynb
This file will generate the poincar√© section plot and the plot of the orbits by calling our class generated in the Chaos.py file.  In the begggining of the file we can change the initial energy E, b and c, the asimetrical parameters, and the reference length rc. The other parameters are fixed to allow bounding states. 
The graphs generated are automatiquely saved in a directory named data. (auto generated)

# Use of gnuplot
First of all, you have to install gnuplot on your device. You can use the Linux Ubuntu terminal command 
```console
sudo apt-get gnuplot
```
Or you can download it [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/) if you are Windows user.

After having installed gnuplot, you can run it with:

```console
gnuplot
```
Or with the executable of windows, and use th files .txt as we will explain here.

1. First of all you have to be in the same directory as the project
2. Then you can draw one of the files to the display of gnuplot and it will execute itself
3. You should have generated the data with plots.ipynb
